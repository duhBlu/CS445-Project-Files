Hello, thanks for reading me.

note: Additional descriptions PD2 requirements are in Project Manual 3.0 Alpha starting on page 12



Requirements Analysis and Modeling Deliverable Elements:

1. Use Case Model (final)
    1.1 Use Case Diagram
        - Finalize Use Case Diagram with clear definition of the actors and use Cases
    1.2 Use Case Descriptions(using the Use Case Description template from Canvas)
        - Refine the Use Case Descriptions from PD1. 
        - Describe clearly the use case preconditions, flows of events and alternative flows.

2. Conceptual Model Class Diagram 
    - Identification of major Entity Classes, Boundary Classes, an Control Classes
        - material found in Bruegge and Dutoit Chapter 5 on Canvas
    - From the Use case Descriptions and the terms in the Data Dictionary from PD1, identify the initial Entity, Boundary and Control objects.

    - From your understanding of the classesâ€™ responsibilities, apply the dependency stereotypes for Entity, Boundary or Control classes and create the early Conceptual Model Class Diagram

    - Create an initial Class Diagram, depicting these classes and the relationships between them. That is, identify associations, generalizations and aggregations where appropriate. 

3. Initial Class Diagram

4. Dynamic Model
    4.1 Sequence Diagrams (Model 3-4 Use Cases at a minimum)
    4.2 State-Chart Diagram
