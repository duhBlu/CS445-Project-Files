# List of Tasks:

## Complete Design Model:

### 1. Class Diagram:
        a. Map important classes from Analysis Model to Design Model
        b. Organize classes and their relationships

    2. Sequence Diagrams (Include remaining use cases):
        a. Update existing sequence diagrams based on additional analysis
        b. Create new sequence diagrams for remaining use cases
        c. Ensure all sequence diagrams represent the behavior of the application

    3. State Chart Diagram:
        a. Update the state chart diagram to reflect user interface states
        b. Ensure the state chart diagram represents the application's user interface throughout

## System Architecture Justification:

    1. Describe the overall architecture of the application
    2. Justify the chosen architecture over alternatives
    3. Discuss chosen technologies and their justification
    4. Address any interesting technology choices made

## Application Skeleton Code:

    1. Generate classes in the programming language based on the class diagram
    2. Organize classes into different packages based on their roles
    3. Create skeleton methods reflecting messages from the sequence diagrams
    4. Document classes and methods using appropriate documentation tools (e.g., JavaDoc)
